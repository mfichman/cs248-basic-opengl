CS 248 Basic OpenGL Demo
========================

Example of basic OpenGL rendering with SDL.

SDL Installation
----------------
To get the demo to work, you have to install the SDL library on your machine.  The myth.stanford.edu machines already have SDL installed, but if you want to use your own machine, then follow the instructions for your platform below.

### Windows

1. Get the binaries here: http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.14-win32.zip

### OS X

1. Get the disk image for SDL here: http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.14.dmg
2. Copy SDL.framework to /Library/Frameworks

### Linux (Ubuntu or similar)

Ubuntu is easy:

  $ sudo apt-get install libsdl-dev

That's it!
